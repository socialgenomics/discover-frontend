  <h1>Interactive Services</h1>
    <p>
      We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including,
      without limitation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chat or similar functionality to enable you to interact directly with other users of our site.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bulletin boards or similar features for posting comments on our site that are
        visible to all or to selected users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to
      you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation
      is used (including whether it is human or technical).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children)
      from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide
      in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what
      kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to
      oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly
      exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service
      by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent
      or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it
      is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation
      is not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the
      potential risks to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means
      of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
    </p>
