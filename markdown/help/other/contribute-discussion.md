## How to contribute to discussion?

Feel free to start a discussion on any dataset. You would start a discussion if:

* You have a question about a dataset that the data source hosts and other members of the Repositive community might be able to answer it for you.

* You have downloaded or investigated that dataset and have more information about that dataset than is listed on Repostiive. By adding this information you will improve the annotation of that dataset and help other members of the community understand its utility.

* Feedback about a dataset might help the data source that produced that dataset or might help other members of the community understand its utility.
