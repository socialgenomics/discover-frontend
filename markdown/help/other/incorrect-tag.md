# What should I do if a previous tag is incorrect?

If you think another annotation is incorrect then we would recommend you note this in the discussion so other users will be informed. You cannot delete an annotation that has been made by another user. However, if an annotation is offensive then please contact us at users@repositive.io so we can deal with it accordingly.
