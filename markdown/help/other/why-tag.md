## Why should I tag a dataset?

By adding more information to a dataset you will make it easier for you and other Repositive users to be able to find that dataset on the Repositive platform. This will reduce the time spent searching and will increase the likelihood that you and others find the data you need. Furthermore, it will help the community gain a greater understanding of the utility of a dataset and reduce the time spent assessing whether or not it is of value to their research project.
