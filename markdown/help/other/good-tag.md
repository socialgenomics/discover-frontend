## What makes a good tag?

Useful tags describe specific details about that dataset. Tags are micro-data that you can use to micro-categorise your content. Unlike categories, tags are not hierarchical and cannot have subtags.   

When writing tags, it is important to use the correct spelling and be mindful of capital and lower case letters and additional characters (e.g. /;-\_). Usually a tag consists of only one word but in some cases two- or three-word tags can be more helpful.  On the Repositive platform each tag should be written and added separately.

A dataset can contain an unlimited number of tags, so you can add as many as you need.
