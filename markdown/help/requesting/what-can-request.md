## What data can I request? 

Our platform is focused only on human genomic data. Please do not request genomic data for plants or animals.

You can make one request for multiple datasets if they are related.

You can make a request for collaborators who may have a specific type of data that you want to work on.

Also think about registering the data you have to find collaborators who may have something similar to enhance both your research studies.
