# What information should I include in my request?

Include as much useful, detailed information as possible. The title should be concise and to-the-point, clearly and briefly explaining what you are looking for. Then add a description of your research question and what you want to do with the data. This can include things like:

* The type of technology used to generate the samples (e.g. Illumina HiSeq).

* The molecule assayed and the type of assay (e.g. DNA and whole exome sequencing).

* The number of samples you need.

* The ethnicity and phenotype of the individuals (e.g. African American and healthy).

* Whether you would like to form a collaboration.

Also think about adding tags to make your data more 'searchable' Link to "What makes a good tag?"

Example:

    Title: RNA-seq of paired breast cancer samples with and without BRCA1 mutations

    Description: For a comparative study, I already have a similar dataset for microarray expression, but I would like to redo the analysis for RNA-seq and investigate the differences. I need at least 5 paired/matched (tumor and blood/non-tumor) samples. Ideally I would like samples from Chinese females aged 40 â€“ 65. I am happy to share the data I have and form a collaboration with someone who has the data I need.
