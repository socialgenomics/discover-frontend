# Can I add more metadata?

Yes. After filling in and submitting the 'register data' form you can add metadata including:
Assay type, Number of samples, Tissue, Technology used for the experiment and PubmedID of the publication associated with the dataset.

It's good practise to add metadata using this form rather than type it in the description. This will structure the dataset information and ultimately improve discoverability on the platform.
