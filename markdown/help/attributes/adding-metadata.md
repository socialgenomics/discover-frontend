# Can I add more metadata to a dataset?

Yes. You can add metadata including: Assay type, Number of samples, Tissue, Technology used for the experiment and Pubmed ID of the publication associated with the dataset.

You can also add further information by commenting on a dataset or adding a tag.

It's good practise to add metadata using this form rather than type it in the description. This will structure the dataset information and ultimately improve discoverability on the platform.
