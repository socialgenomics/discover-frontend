# Can I edit my dataset and add more description later?

Yes. You can edit the title and description of the dataset you have registered anytime by clicking on the pencil icon placed close to the dataset title in the top right corner. Only you can edit your dataset's title and description, you cannot edit anyone else's dataset title and description.
