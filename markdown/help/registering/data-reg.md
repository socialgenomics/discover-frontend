## What data can I register?

There are three types of data you can register on Repositive:

1. If you know of a dataset that is available online but is not listed on Repositive. You can register this dataset, fill in the description and copy the URL link that will lead users to where they can download that data.

2. If you have a dataset that is not available online that you would like to share online. Firstly you should submit this data to an online repository. If this data is to be open access consider Figshare or Dryad, if you want to put access restrictions on the data you should consider EGA or dbGaP. You can then register this dataset on Repositive, make a description and copy the URL link that will lead users to where they can download that data. For more information about where you can submit data see our [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002418).

3. If you have a dataset that is not available online and for which you would like to find collaborators. You can register this dataset, make a description and users will be able to discuss with you via the Repositive platform how to collaborate in using that data.
