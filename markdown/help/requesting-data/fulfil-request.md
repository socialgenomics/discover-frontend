# I know where the requested data are. How can I respond to the request?

If the data are not indexed in our database you can register them first (link how to register data) then simply add the link to the discussion on the request to which you are responding. The person who made the request will be notified about your response.

If the data is indexed in REPOSITIVE then copy the link and paste to the discussion of the request to which you are responding.

We are currently working on improving this feature. If you have any ideas you can [let us know](mailto:users@repositive.io).
