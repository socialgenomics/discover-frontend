# How do I search on Repositive?

Identify your research questions (e.g. Which genes predispose women in China to breast cancer?)
Identify the key concepts for your search. (e.g. breast cancer, female, Chinese).

Enter these key concepts as keywords into the search box and press Enter.

You do not need to put a comma between search terms. You can then refine your search using the filters to select specific data sources, assay types or access types of interest.

If you are struggling to narrow down your search and are getting lots of results try to use more specific keywords. If you are not getting any or enough results with your searches, try to make your search terms less specific.

If you would like to see only datasets containing your searched keywords in the exact order you can wrap these terms with quotation marks " " (e.g "breast cancer")

You can use predicates to make more advanced search queries.
