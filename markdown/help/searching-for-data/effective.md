# How to build more advanced search queries?

You can try predicated search terms to help you refine your search.

Predicate terms filter search results to match a specified metadata field and value. Because the inconsistency in terminology used by different data sources your search results will vary based on the format of your searched keyword. Hyphens, upper and lower cases can make big difference in your search results.

 
You can apply multiple predicate filters to a single search query.

Example: Searching title:"breast cancer" description:"Chinese" datasource:SRA would show all results that have the words "breast cancer" in the title, "Chinese" in the description and are sourced from the SRA data source.

List of predicated search terms with examples:

	• title: Alzheimer
	• description: Alzheimer late-onset
	• collection: "Single Cell Sequencing Data"
	• datasource: ARRAY_EXPRESS
	• tag: reference
	• assay: ChIP-Seq
