## What do all those filters mean?

**Assay Type** describes the general molecular method used to process the samples for genomics analysis. For example: RNA-Seq or SNP-Array.  

**Access Type** describes whether a dataset is publicly available or if you need to pay for or apply for access to download the data. On Repositive we use two types access:  

* **Open access** means that data are free to download. In some cases you need to register with the provider of data. Usually they ask for email address and affiliation. Please note if you have commercial interests the regulations can be different.  After the registration the data are available to download.  

* **Restricted access** doesn't allow you to download data directly. Instead you will need to pay for or apply for access to download the data.  

The process of applying for access to restricted data varies depending on the data source. Usually you need to fill an application form and then wait for data provider's committee to review your application before you will be able to download the data. This process can take some time. You can read more about applying for access to dbGaP and EGA datasets in our blog (link to blog).  

Some restricted access datasets may require you to pay for the data rather than filling in an application form. While in some cases you may need to pay and fill out an application form.

**Data Sources** are any place where human genomics data are stored or managed.

*Technology describes the specific technology/platform or analytic machinery involved in the sample processing. For example: Affymetrix or Illumina HiSeq.*
