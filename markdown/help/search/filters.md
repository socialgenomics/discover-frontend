## What do all those filters mean?

**Assay Type** describes the general molecular method used to process the samples for genomic analysis. For example: RNA-Seq or SNP-Array.  

**Access Type** describes whether a dataset is publicly available or if you need to pay for or apply for access to download the data. On Repositive, we have data with two types of access:  

* **Open access** means that data are free to download. In some cases you need to register with the data provider. Usually they ask for an email address and affiliation. Please note if you have commercial interests the regulations can be different.  After the registration the data are available to download.  

* **Restricted access** doesn't allow you to download data directly. Instead you will need to pay for or apply for access to download the data.  

The process of applying for access to restricted data varies depending on the data source. Usually you need to fill in an application form and then wait for the data provider's Data Access Committee (DAC) to review your application before you will be able to download the data. This process can take some time. You can [read more about applying for access to dbGaP and EGA datasets on our blog](http://blog.repositive.io/how-to-successfully-apply-for-access-to-ega/).  

Some restricted access datasets may require you to pay for the data rather than filling in an application form. In other cases, you may need to both pay and complete an application form.

A **Data Source** is any place where human genomic data are stored or managed.

*Technology describes the specific technology/platform or analytic machinery involved in the sample processing. For example: Affymetrix or Illumina HiSeq.*
