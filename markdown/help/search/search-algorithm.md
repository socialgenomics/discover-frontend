# How does the search algorithm work?

At Repositive we use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) to power our search engine. When you search for a keyword on Repositive, you are searching through all metadata on our database (including any additional metadata that isn't displayed on the platform).

You can use both [Boolean](/help/searching-for-data?help=boolean) and [predicated search terms](/help/searching-for-data?help=predicated) with the Repositive search.
