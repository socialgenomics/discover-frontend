# What predicated search terms can I use?

Predicated searches allow you to specify which metadata field you want the search to be performed in. Currently on Repositive you can predicate with:

* Title `title:`
* Description `description:`

For instance: `title: breast cancer` will show you results that have the word 'breast cancer' in the title.  

And 'title: breast cancer description: female Chinese' will show you results that have the words 'breast cancer' in the title and 'female Chinese' in the description.  

You can use booleans as well to exclude/include other search words: `title: cancer NOT description: breast`.
