## How can I build my search query to make it more effective?

If you are struggling to drill down your search and are getting lots of results try to use more specific keywords. Furthermore, you can try to use Boolean and predicated search terms to help you refine your search.

If you are not getting any or enough results with your searches, try to make your search terms less specific.
