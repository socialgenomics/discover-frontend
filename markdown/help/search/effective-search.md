## How can I build my search query to make it more effective?

If you are getting too many results, try to use more specific keywords. You can also use [Boolean](/help/searching-for-data?help=boolean) and [predicated](help/searching-for-data?help=predicated) search terms to help you refine your search.

If you are not getting enough results with your searches, try to make your search terms less specific.
