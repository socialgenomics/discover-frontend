# What information should I include in my registration?

Include as much useful, detailed information as possible. The title should be concise and to-the-point, clearly and briefly explaining what data you are listing. Then add a description of your data and what the data has been or could be used for. This can include items such as:

- The original hypothesis that lead to this study.
- What your findings were.
- The ethnicity and phenotype of the individuals (e.g. African American and healthy).
- Whether you would like to form a collaboration.
- Who you are willing to share the data with.

Also think about adding tags to make your [data more 'searchable'](/help/other/good-tag).
