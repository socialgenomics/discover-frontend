# What information should I include in my registration?

Include as much useful, detailed information as possible. The title should be concise and to-the-point, clearly and briefly explaining what data you are listing. Then add a description of your data and what the data has been or could be used for. This can include items such as:

* The type of technology used to generate the samples (e.g. Illumina HiSeq).

* The molecule assayed and the type of assay (e.g. DNA and whole exome sequencing).

* The number of samples you have.

* The ethnicity and phenotype of the individuals (e.g. African American and healthy).

* Whether you would like to form a collaboration.

* Who you are willing to share the data with.

Also think about adding tags to make your [data more 'searchable'](/help/other?help=good-tag).
