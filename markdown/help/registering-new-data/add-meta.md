# Can I add more metadata and description later?

After you have submitted your registration:

- You can improve the metadata and 'searchability' of your dataset by adding attributes: Assay type, Number of samples, Tissue, Technology used for the experiment and Pubmed ID of the publication associated with the dataset. It's good practise to add metadata using this form rather than type it in the description. This will structure the dataset information and ultimately improve discoverability on the platform.These can all be edited or removed at any point by clicking the pencil or dustbin icon.
- You can also add tags and further comments via discussions. These can all be edited or removed at any point by clicking the pencil or dustbin icon.
- You can edit the title and description by clicking the little pencil button. Only you can edit your dataset's title and description, you cannot edit anyone else's dataset title and description.
